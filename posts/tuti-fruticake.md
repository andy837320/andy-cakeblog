sugar, salt,home temp milk, baking powder and
baking soda,valilla extract, tuti fruti(1 packet)

  <li> <strong> Time taken : <strong> total 3.5 hours
  <li> <strong> Level : </strong> Easy
</ol>

## procedure

Bring all the ingredients at room temperature.
Use fresh leavening agents or Baking powder & baking soda while making any baked goodies. Use up the expired or old stuffs as cleaning agents. You might think that they are just powders & they never go bad, but they do loose their potent.
If the eggs are a bit cold, immerse them in warm water for a couple of minutes to up the temperature.
Cream the butter & sugar very well until light, fluffy & airy. Both hand whisk & machine whisk works well. You just need a little more time to hand whisk them.
Beat them at medium speed. To hurry the process never beat them at the highest speed. Over-beating is not good.
Add the eggs one at a time & beat them well until smooth, light & well incorporated with the creamy butter & sugar (refer the pics).
To prevent the Tutti Frutti from sinking at the bottom of the cake add about 1 tbsp Maida or all-purpose flour to the tutti frutti & coat well before adding them to the batter.
After adding the Tutti Frutti to the cake batter do not beat just fold with the help of a spatula. We don‚Äôt want to knock out the air from the batter.
For a light, airy, fluffy cake always sift the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients.
Grease the cake mold well & either dust it with flour/maida or line it with a parchment paper.
Do not try to de-mold the cake when it‚Äôs hot. It might fall apart as it‚Äôs very tender when hot.
After about 15-20 mins de-mold gently on a wire rack and allow the Tutti Frutti cake to cool down completely before slicing.
Do not open the oven door for the first 30 mins because the temperature in the oven drops suddenly. It‚Äôs a very basic tip to prevent the cake from sinking.
Do the toothpick taste. Every oven is different so your cake might need 4-5 mins more time to bake than mine. No big deal, just poke & check the doneness.
