## PREPARATION

STEP 1
Cake Layers:
Mix each cake as directed on the box, one at a time. Divide each batch of batter in half and separate into bowls.

Add your choice of food coloring to each batter. When you are done, you should have six different color batters from 3 cake mixes.

Using an 8 by 8 inch inch pan for each layer, bake according to package instructions.

Remove from pans and cool on wire racks.

When the cakes are cool, you may have to shave the risen part of each layer so that it will sit level in the stack.

Fondant:
In a large, nonmetal bowl, sift 2 pounds confectioner's sugar and make a well in the center. Set aside.

In a small saucepan, add water and sprinkle gelatin on top to soften for about 5 minutes.

Begin to heat the gelatin and stir until the gelatin is dissolved and clear. Do not boil.

Remove from heat and add glucose and glycerine, stirring until well blended. Add flavoring.

Pour into the well of sugar, and mix until all of the sugar is blended. Use hands to knead icing until it becomes stiff. Add small amounts of confectioner's sugar if the mixture is sticky.

Divide into 6 equal portions and knead in food coloring to match the cake layers.

Form into balls and wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Place in an airtight container. This icing works best if allowed to rest at room temperature for about eight hours before using, particularly if the weather is humid. Do not refrigerate.

To cover a cake with fondant:
Dust a clean pastry cloth, or a smooth, clean surface with cornstarch and roll the fondant with a rolling pin until it is approximately 1/4 inch thick. Make sure that the fondant is large enough to fit over the top and sides of the cake. Slide both hands under the fondant and carefully center it on top of a cake that has been freshly iced with buttercream. (The icing makes the fondant adhere to the cake.)

Dust your hands with cornstarch and smooth the fondant, starting at the top and working down the sides until the entire surface is even and flat. Cut off excess fondant.

Decorate the cake to resemble a polo shirt with buttercream or royal icing.

This fondant keeps the cake fresh for two days at room temperature. Do not refrigerate a cake with fondant icing.

Enjoy the cake :)
